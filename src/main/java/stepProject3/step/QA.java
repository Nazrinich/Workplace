  /**
   * In our dao layer we have only 4 methods:
   * - getAll,
   * - get(int id),
   * - remove() and
   * - add(T object)
   * which are for working with database.
   * For any other operations we use service layer,
   * by accessing dao's getAll method we get all objects
   * from database and search for specific ones .
   * However, this can also be done by writing
   * more queries in dao layer.
   *
   * Which one is a better approach,
   * to keep Dao simple as possible
   * or having a lot of queries in it ?
